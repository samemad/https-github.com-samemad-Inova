this project has been develpoed using clean Archtecture with SOLID Prnciple ! 
in order to be able to understand the ASP.Net , U have to llearn the C# from W3School or any other platform cuz the .NET here is about 90% C# language
it is important to understand the C# language first with the OOP concepts !! 
After u have done with the C# , OOP . then U have to understand the SOLID Priniple cuz they explain the OOP in more advance and applying OOP concespts !
then u have to learn the clean Archtecture in order to understand how to structure the project in a more professional way 
clean Archtecture is only 4 seprate layers , each Layer has its job , their benifits to be able o maintain the project in a more easier way
and to be able to test the project in a more easier way
and to be able to develope the project in a more easier way
even if u  want to changw the DB , u have only to change the infra layer without touching the other layers!!
if u do not understand any of the above concepts , u will find it hard to understand the project strucutre and the code it self !!
so u have to learn them first before u start to understand the project one by one ! 
C# >> OOP >> SOLID >> Clean Archtecture >> ASP.Net Core 
if u do not understand anything cotnact me ^^ Alsamemad775@gmail.com 
wish u all the best
